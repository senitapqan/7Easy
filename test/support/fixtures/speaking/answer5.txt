Spending time in nature can significantly improve a person’s mental health and well-being. It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and feelings of depression by providing a peaceful and calming environment. Nature also encourages physical activity, such as walking or hiking, which is beneficial for both the body and mind. Personally, I feel more refreshed, positive, and mentally clear after spending time outdoors, even if it’s just a short walk in a park.

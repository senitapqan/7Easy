I enjoy listening to acoustic and soft pop music. I find these genres very relaxing and uplifting, especially when Iâ€™m working or studying. Artists like Ed Sheeran and Taylor Swift often help me to stay in a good mood throughout the day. I believe that calm music improves my productivity and emotional well-being.
